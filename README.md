## This is code snippet of production ADGSTUDIOS code to anonymize data. 

1. The code imports the necessary modules and classes from the Presidio library and the regular expression module (`re`).

2. The `anonymize` function takes a `text_to_anonymize` parameter as input.

3. An `AnalyzerEngine` object is created to analyze the text for different entities like phone numbers, person names, locations, IDs, titles, and email addresses. The `analyze` method is called with the specified entities and the text to be analyzed.

4. An `AnonymizerEngine` object is created to perform the anonymization. The `anonymize` method is called with the original text, the analyzer results, and a dictionary of operators and their configurations.

5. Within the operators dictionary, there is a "DEFAULT" operator that replaces any identified entity with the value "<ANONYMIZED>". For specific entities like phone numbers, person names, locations, IDs, titles, and email addresses, the "mask" operator is used. The "mask" operator replaces characters in the identified entity with a masking character (in this case, "*") while keeping the last 12 characters intact.

6. The `anonymized_results` object contains the anonymized text.

7. The `re.sub` function is used to perform a regular expression-based replacement in the `output` text. The regular expression `r'^[0-9]{13}$'` matches a sequence of 13 digits from the beginning to the end of the text. If such a pattern is found, it is replaced with "*****".

8. The `output` text is returned as the anonymized result.

By using the Presidio library and the provided operators, the code analyzes and anonymizes the text by replacing sensitive information with predefined values or masking characters, ensuring the privacy and protection of personal data.

## Getting Started
```bash
chmod +x ./install.sh
./install.sh
```

### Usage Example
